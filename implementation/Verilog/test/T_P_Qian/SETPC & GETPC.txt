# it reads a value from input line to x1
# it also tries to add x1 by 1 in the middle of the program
# it tries to use getpc and setpc to skip adding x1 by 1
# so, if x1 is still the same as input line, getpc and setpc should work correctly

read x1
getpc x2
addi x2 x2 8
setpc x2
addi x1 x1 1
write x1
stop
